# Communication Apprehension Calculator (JS)

The goal of this project was to convert my [PHP Calculator](https://github.com/vernak2539/PHP-Communication-Apprehension-Calculator) to Javascript.

## What is Communication Apprehension?

Communication apprehension (CA) is defined as an “individual’s level of fear or anxiety associated with either real or anticipated communication with another person or persons” - McCroskey


## How is it calculated?

Using McCroskey's Personal Report of Communication Apprehension (PRCA-24) we can calculate an individuals score based on 24 questions, divided into 4 categories with 6 questions each. These categories are (1) public speaking, (2) interpersonal, (3) group, and (4) meeting skills.

McCroskey Says: 

> The PRCA-24 is the instrument which is most widely used to measure communication apprehension. It is preferable above all earlier versions of the instrument (PRCA, PRCA10, PRCA-24B, etc.). It is highly reliable (alpha regularly >.90) and has very high predictive validity. It permits one to obtain sub-scores on the contexts of public speaking, dyadic interaction, small groups, and large groups. However, these scores are substantially less reliable than the total PRCA-24 scores-because of the reduced number of items. People interested only in public speaking anxiety should consider using the PRPSA rather than the public speaking sub-score drawn from the PRCA-24. It is much more reliable for this purpose.

## What is the goal of this repo?

This is just a fun little experiment for me. I coded, quite badly if I do say so, a PHP version when I was doing my thesis, so I wanted to make it better and learn more in the process.
